# octo-eureka
hello !


 I am on a first job in a company, the subject I am working on is worded as follows: "Development of a report management application and meeting procedures"
the technology chosen to develop the solution is asp.net MVC with the programming language C #, Editor Vs studio 2015, SGBD sql server 2012 ... So I would like to have if possible guidance on the approach to adopt, currently I am doing research on the existing components (code blocks) that can start some functonnalt√©s of the application in particular:
- management of a collaborative space that should allow a permanent exchange of data between users and user groups on various topics (business tasks, meeting diligence) ...
-Reporting report
-Assignment of tasks, task processing, task tracking ...
-Being in a structured organization with several levels of decision-making (General Management - Pole Management, Department Direction, Service Heads & Associates, with executing staff), we should be able to collaborate between actors of a given service wherever they are located at the level of the hierarchical tree manage to locate the shared responsibilities on the executed task, but also for positions related to the decision-makers to be able to follow all the activities placed under their direction .... In the set briefly describes the project.
